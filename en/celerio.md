# Celerio's pragmatic model-driven approach
## Celerio
To increase your software team productivity, you must have the best brain in town, 
be Agile, select the right tools and spend as little time as possible on pure technical considerations.

Celerio is a development tool that allows teams to generate the pure technical part 
of web-based applications that need to be robust, modular, scalable and maintainable. 

Celerio is not another UML-based tool requiring new skills, Celerio is a 
pragmatic model-driven development tool that leverage the best Open Source technologies,
the best practices of our industry and the best existing tools. 
Celerio itself is not required at Runtime.

Celerio is easy to use and learn as long as you already know Java and SQL. 
It generates a clean, documented, unit-tested source code written by our senior software engineers.
By just looking at the code your team learns the underlying technologies and naturally adhere to 
following the best practices.

For all these reasons, Celerio is ideally suited to environments promoting Agile methodologies.
